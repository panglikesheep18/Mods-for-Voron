mods i made for Voron 0:

optical endstop to eliminate infuriating offset caused by heat expansion and cool shrinking from mechanical endstops (requires Kirigami bed and ability to home to ZMAX [https://github.com/christophmuellerorg/voron_0_kirigami_bed])
modded TopHat made from scratch inspired from people in GitHub
skirtless solid bottom (but the catch is the machine will wobble more but center of gravity and the surface it is placed on makes it's wobble less noticable)
small vent
XT60 input connector because this mod is made to be "portable"
it's disbenefit is now the chamber can get a bit too hot and it seemed ineffective so i would redesign the filter to pull more air and to be cross-compatible with my modded Voron Trident in the future
