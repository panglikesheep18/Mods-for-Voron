mods i made for Voron 0:

-optical endstop to eliminate infuriating offset caused by heat expansion and cool shrinking from mechanical endstops (requires Kirigami bed and ability to home to ZMAX [https://github.com/christophmuellerorg/voron_0_kirigami_bed])
-~modded TopHat made from scratch inspired from people in GitHub~ would redesign it to work with V0.2
-redesigned bottom part
-adjustable OLED display
- 2 custom PCBs, including JST PDB for power disturbition with JST connectors and Simple-Display-MODDED for my modded version of [https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Hardware/tree/master/V0_Simple_Display] (VoronDesign/Voron-Hardware/V0_Simple_Display).
- more airflow for cooling electronics
-XT60 input connector because this mod is made to be "portable"
-it's disbenefit is now the chamber can get a bit too hot and it seemed ineffective so i would redesign the filter to pull more air and to be cross-compatible with my modded Voron Trident in the future
