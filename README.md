# Voron 3D printer mods from panglikesheep18

super spicy mods for Voron 3D printer that does not make sense for everyday use except me

for Voron 0 i made it skirtless and solid bottom (but the catch is the machine will wobble more but center of gravity and the surface it is placed on makes it's wobble less noticable), features a small vent, modded TopHat made from scratch inspired from people in GitHub and it's panels, and has an XT60 connector instead of AC input because this mod is made to be "portable"
it's disbenefit is now the chamber can get a bit too hot so now i am experimenting with adaptive chamber cooling and redesigning the filter to pull more air and to be cross-compatible with my modded Voron Trident in the future
it also potentially suffers on echoing from modded Tophat and i will solve this issue in the future


for Voron Trident i made it 150mm^2 X 140mm Z and the feet is 1mm between the bare bottom and the skirt (but the catch is that it must be placed on flat surface, features a small vent, a 3D printable power panel that houses Adamstech IEC connector and an XT60 input <!--(can be limited to 1 input to not make people say "hol'up" with the flippy thing)-->
it's disbenefit is now the chamber can get a bit too hot but "if it works it works"

in the future i will build a battery pack to power my Voron 0 anywhere with a mount for it
