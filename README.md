# Voron 3D printer mods from panglikesheep18

super spicy mods for Voron 3D printer that does not make sense for everyday use except me

mods i made for [Voron 0](./Voron%200) :

- optical endstop to eliminate infuriating offset caused by heat expansion and cool shrinking from mechanical endstops (requires Kirigami bed and ability to home to ZMAX [https://github.com/christophmuellerorg/voron_0_kirigami_bed])

- ~modded TopHat made from scratch inspired from people in GitHub~ would redesign it to work with V0.2
- redesigned bottom part
- tiltable OLED display
- 2 custom PCBs, including JST PDB for power disturbition with JST connectors and Simple-Display-MODDED for my modded version of [https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Hardware/tree/master/V0_Simple_Display] (VoronDesign/Voron-Hardware/V0_Simple_Display).
- more airflow for cooling electronics
- XT60 input connector because this mod is made to be "portable"

- it's disbenefit is now the chamber can get a bit too hot and it seemed ineffective so i would redesign the filter to pull more air and to be cross-compatible with my modded Voron Trident in the future


mods i made for Voron Trident:
- 150mm^2 X 140mm Z print size
- space between it's skirt and the ground it is standing on is 1mm through 3D printed mods (but the catch is that it must be placed on flat surface)
- features a small vent
- a 3D printable power panel that houses Adamstech IEC connector and XT60 input <!--(can be limited to 1 input to not make people say "hol'up" with the flippy thing)-->

it's disbenefit is now the chamber can get a bit too hot but "if it works it works"
If you don't want to make your Voron Trident goofy looking consider making https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/Tiny-T. 

goals for them are to make them goofy looking and not so serious by making modded parts to make them look better

in the future i will build a battery pack to power my Voron 0 anywhere with a mount for it
